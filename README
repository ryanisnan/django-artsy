django-artsy

Artsy is a django-based portfolio application for graphic designers and artists.

Artsy typically is envisioned to be an integral part of an artist's website, and as such relies on the project to supply templates for artsy's various views.

The three template files artsy expects to exist are:
1. project_index.html
2. project_detail.html
3. category_index.html

These files can reside in one of your project's available template directories. See the directory exampletemplates for samples.
